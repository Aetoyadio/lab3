                    “The International University of Information Technology guarantees the fulfillment of institutional, procedural and cultural requirements for quality teaching and successful learning,” confirm experts from ASIIN (Agency for Accreditation of Educational Programs in Engineering, Computer Science, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Germany).<br>
                    
                    Over 10 years of development, IITU was able to firmly enter the ranking of the best technical universities in the country. The university is constantly working to improve the quality of educational services and ensures the high potential of its teaching staff.<br>
                    
                    In December 2019, according to the rating of the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs “Atameken”, MUIT entered the TOP-3 universities in Kazakhstan, as well as first place in such educational programs as “information systems” and “electronic journalism”.<br>
